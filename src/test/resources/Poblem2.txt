Postive Scenarios

1. When none of the date range does not overlaps --Expected Programme execution successfully--> P0 test case [Crtical]
2. When atleast two date range overlaps -----Expected Programme execution successfully------> p0 test case [Critical]

Negative Scenarios

1. When the date range is not in the expected format ----Expected Proper error message-------> p1 test case [Important]
2. In the date range, date2 is smaller than date1 -----Expected Proper error message-----> p1 test case [Important]
2. Instead of date datatype, different datatype like String or int passed ------Expected Proper error message-----> p1 test case [Important]


Logic used for pragramming :

If end date in the date range is greater than any of the start date in the date range then those both date range overlaps
